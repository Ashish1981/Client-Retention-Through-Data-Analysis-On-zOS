# The Client Retention Demo

This demo is an exploritory Jupyter Notebook.  It analyzes customer data, and customer credit card transactions data which is on the Mainframe, to discover potential factors of why they would leave the bank.

When giving the demo, you need to setup the backstory.  The backstory of the demo is that you are a bank that is experiencing customer retention issues, or in data scientist terms, Customer Churn.  Now, the data science team, you, will need to analyze the data to see what features are good indicators of a potential churn.

This demo is written in Python and includes many of the top Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib.  It is also doing machine learning with Scikit-Learn.
